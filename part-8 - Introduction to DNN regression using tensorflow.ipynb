    "**Part 8: Introduction to DNN regression using tensorflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the part 0 we did some basic prepossing. Parts 1-6 contained further data processing and linear regession predictions. Part 7 summarised the linear regression results and made some final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we do predictions with the DNN Regressor from tensorflow. DNN stands for Deep Neural Network, and we give a brief intuitive introduction to these in step 2 below. First however we must preprocess the data in a similar, but not identical, way to the linear regression preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Data preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the code is the same as in part 7 for linear regression, but there are some differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We investigate correlations after log transforming the train SalePrice, which is more appropriate in this case (WHY????).\n",
    "    2. We do not do the one-hot encoding of the categorical features, because, as we shall see, the DNN-regressor in tensorflow has a different way of dealing with categorical features.\n",
    "    3. We include the normalisation step (step 5 of part 0), as the DNN-regressor algorithms train better with scaled numerical features with values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    4. For the moment, we remove all considerations of outliers. This will be included when we give the fill code in part 9.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Other slight code changes are also needed. For example, when investigating weak and strong correlations, we now restrict our attention to the numerical features as we have not one-hot encoded the categorical features."

Moreover the 'best' such approximation can be 'approached' gradually over a series of steps, using gradient descent on a neural network or some similar process.
